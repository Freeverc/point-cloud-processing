# Point Cloud Proccessing
Some simple point cloud processing projects base on pcl, matlab, open3d, etc.
## Point Cloud Clustering
- Point cloud clustering in multi methods for lazor point cloud data.
  + Voxel sample and euclidean cluster 
  + Super voxel cluster 
  + K-means 
  + Region growth 
  + LCCP
  + DBScan
- Tools 
  + cpp, pcl
  + python, open3d
