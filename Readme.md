# Point Cloud Proccessing
Some simple point cloud processing projects base on pcl, matlab, open3d, etc.

## Point Cloud Clustering
- Point cloud clustering in multi methods for lazor point cloud data.
  + Voxel sample and euclidean cluster 
  + Super voxel cluster 
  + K-means 
  + Region growth 
  + LCCP
- Tools 
  + cpp, pcl

## Point Cloud Measuring 
- Measuring the error of mechanical parts.
  + Project points to triangle mesh.
- Tools 
  + matlab

- Measuring the size of machine parts.
  + Detect circles in the machine parts.
- Tools 
  + c++, pcl

## Point Cloud Visualizing 
- Visualizing
  + Visualizing the point cloud by distance to camera or distance to plane detected.
- Tools 
  + python, open3d

## Mesh to scaned images 
- Read a mesh and transfrom it to scaned slices.
  + c++, opencv
  + Calculate the intersections of a plane and a triangle mesh
